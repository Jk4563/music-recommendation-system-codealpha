Music Recommendation System

Overview

The Music Recommendation System is a project aimed at providing personalized music recommendations to users based on their preferences and listening history. By analyzing user behavior and music features, the system suggests tracks, albums, or playlists that users are likely to enjoy.

Features

Personalized Recommendations: The system analyzes user listening history, favorite genres, and explicit preferences to generate personalized recommendations.
Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to recommend music based on similar users' preferences.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends music based on the features of songs that the user has liked or listened to in the past.
Hybrid Approaches: Combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations.
User Interaction: Allows users to rate recommended songs, skip tracks, or provide feedback to improve future recommendations.
Integration with Music Streaming Platforms: Integrates with popular music streaming platforms (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music) to access user data and music catalogs.
Installation
To run the Music Recommendation System, follow these steps:

Clone the repository from GitHub: git clone https://github.com/jk4563/music-recommendation-system.git
Install dependencies using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up API keys and credentials for accessing music streaming platforms (e.g., Spotify, Last.fm).
Configure the system parameters, such as recommendation algorithms, data sources, and user preferences.
Usage
Data Collection: Collect user listening history, preferences, and music metadata from streaming platforms or other sources.
Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data, extract relevant features, and prepare it for training or inference.
Model Training: Train recommendation models using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches.
Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of recommendation models using metrics such as precision, recall, and Mean Average Precision (MAP).
Deployment: Deploy the trained models as a web service or integrate them into existing music streaming platforms for real-time recommendations.
User Interaction: Allow users to interact with the recommendation system through a web interface, mobile app, or voice-enabled device.
Feedback Loop: Incorporate user feedback and interaction data to continuously improve the recommendation algorithms and enhance the user experience.
